## 🎯 **Next Steps for Team**

### **Data Engineer (Person 1)**
1. Connect real county demographic data to `/api/counties/{id}` endpoint
2. Integrate KPLC/KenGen APIs for live blackout data
3. Add solar irradiance data from weather APIs
4. Set up automated data refresh pipelines

### **AI Engineers (Person 2 + 3)**
1. **Person 2**: Enhance county-level prioritization algorithm
2. **Person 3**: Optimize mini-grid simulation with real-time data
3. Both: Improve AI recommendation accuracy with real datasets

### **Business Analyst (Person 5)**
1. Create demo script showcasing the streamlined workflow
2. Prepare pitch deck with before/after user experience
3. Develop ROI metrics showing improved decision-making speed

## 🎉 **Demo Flow**

1. **Open Dashboard** → Shows Kenya map with priority counties highlighted
2. **Click Turkana County** → Instantly get AI analysis: "High priority, Solar mini-grid, $2.5M investment"  
3. **View Simulation** → Live mini-grid performance with 100kW solar + 400kWh battery
4. **Check Monitoring** → Real-time alerts: "60 blackouts/month, Grid 45km away"
5. **Get Recommendations** → "Install 2MW solar system, Serve 12,000 households, 15.2% ROI"

**Result**: Complete energy analysis and optimization plan in under 30 seconds! 🚀
