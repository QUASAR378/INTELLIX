# 🚀 **FIXED: Backend Connection Issues**

## ✅ **Problem Resolved**

The frontend was trying to connect to the old hardcoded port 8000, but our backend is running on port 8002. I've fixed all the connection issues:

### **🔧 Changes Made**

1. **Fixed API Health Check**: Updated `testConnection()` in `api.js` to use correct port 8002
2. **Fixed Health API**: Updated `healthAPI` endpoints to use dynamic base URL  
3. **Updated Error Messages**: Changed App.jsx to show correct port 8002
4. **Dynamic URLs**: All API calls now use `API_BASE_URL` instead of hardcoded ports

### **✅ Current Status**

- **Backend**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:8002
- **Frontend**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:5174  
- **API Health**: ✅ All endpoints responding correctly
- **Connection**: ✅ Frontend can now connect to backend

### **🎯 Test Results**

```bash
# Backend Health Check
curl http://localhost:8002/health
# ✅ {"status":"healthy","message":"API is running smoothly"}

# Counties API
curl http://localhost:8002/api/counties/
# ✅ Returns full county data

# Dashboard API  
curl http://localhost:8002/api/dashboard/overview
# ✅ Returns dashboard statistics
```

## 🌐 **How to Access**

1. **Open http://localhost:5174** in your browser
2. You should now see the full dashboard (no more connection error!)
3. Click on any county for AI analysis

## 🎯 **Verification Steps**

1. ✅ Backend running: `curl http://localhost:8002/health`
2. ✅ Frontend accessible: Open http://localhost:5174
3. ✅ Connection working: No more "Backend Connection Failed" error
4. ✅ County selection: Click Turkana to see AI recommendations

## 🚀 **Next Actions**

The dashboard should now be fully functional! You can:
